## HOW IT WORKS

There is a river on the far left hand side whose level is controlled by a slider. A dig/mound tool allows the user to remove soil to (dig) create a basin, trench, ditch, or other waterway; or to (mound) create dikes or river banks. 

## HOW TO USE IT

press `setup` then `go`
slowly increase the river level using the slider and observe

press `setup` again
switch `mouse-tool?` on
select `dig` or `mound`
use the mouse to dig or mound
slowly increase the river level using the slider and observe

## THINGS TO NOTICE

headward erosion threatens the orphanage near the cliff
soil deposits are shown in red

## THINGS TO TRY

Try to prevent flooding of the town headward erosion while irrigating the crops

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Crops could change depending on water conditions.
Houses and orphanage could respond to flooding.
